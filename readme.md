# Ask me anything!

## [Ask a question](../../issues/new) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Read questions](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

I get <del>a lot</del> of questions by email.
This way anyone can read the answer.

Anything means anything.
Personal questions.
Money.
Life.
Code.
Whatever.

If they question fits the guidelines laid out below, I'll answer it.

#### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Be civil and polite :)
- I will not help you with a question that goes against my personal moral standards.

*I can also be reached on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/habi) and [email](mailto:ama@davidhaberthuer.ch), but I thought one could try [this medium](https://github.com/habi/ama/issues/new) here.*
